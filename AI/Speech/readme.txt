Speech
500

While wandering in a foreign country, 
you overhear a short conversation that contains critical information about an imminent terror attack. 
A field agent that accompanied you intercepted a single sentence using a malfunctioning 
device such that only the Spectrogram of the conversation was persisted but not the actual audio file itself. 
Additionally, the agent who is a polyglot, tells you that he thinks the conversation was in Mongolian.

Coincidently, you are a data scientist working in a speech to text (STT) research lab.

What is being said in the sentence?

Your task is to reconstruct an audible file from the spectrogram (a numpy array) and reveal what was said. 
Once you are done, using STT or otherwise, translate the sentence to English.

We expect a 10-word sentence in English - NOT in Cyrillic.

you should only use the attached binary Spectogram file

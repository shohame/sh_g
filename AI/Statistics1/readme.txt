Imagine you are a data scientist working alongside Marie Curie; 
a Laurent and a physicist. Inspired by her work on radiation, 
she comes up with an idea for creating a new stochastic neural network layer entitled "RadiumDropout". 
The suggested layer behaves as follows.

For each K'th neuron, an eight-sided die is tossed K times. 
The dropout is activated with probability of 1 if and only if the sum of the K tosses is larger than 3^K, 
and a probability of 0 otherwise.

What is the probability that the first neuron is dropped?

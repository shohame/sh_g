During your research on image similarity methods, 
you discover a corpus made of images, 
only to find out that the original images were deleted by their creator and only their 512D feature vector was saved. 
You are now provided with a single such binary vector (a pickled numpy array), 
which was created from a ResNet18 model (PyTorch), pre-trained on the ImageNet corpus.

Your task is to identify the object that appeared in the original image.

The attached image file contains a hint regarding the identity of said object.

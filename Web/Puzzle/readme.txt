Puzzle
300

Nati Plemental applied for a job in the ISA. As a recruitment assignment, 
he was challenged to solve our puzzle. Unfortunately, 
instead of focusing on actually solving the puzzle, 
Nati wasted his time and effort on adding meaningless features.

Nati was not good enough. We decided not to recruit him.

Note: This is not a typical WEB challenge.

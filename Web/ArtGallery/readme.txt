Art Gallery
300

Pnina Terest applied for a job in the ISA. 
We asked her to implement a web-based art gallery to store all of ISA's best pictures. 
When Pnina submitted her finished work, we were disappointed to find out that she did not 
implement some of the features we requested. 
However, when we asked Pnina about this, 
she insisted that she'd implemented each and every feature and that we didn't look hard enough.

Pnina is annoying. We decided not to recruit her.

Jeff D. Spleier applied for a job in the ISA. 
His interview went really well and he seemed the right man for the job.

Naturally, we decided not to recruit him.

We suspect that he is in possession of some classified documents that must not be leaked. 
We worry that he might act out his revenge and publish them. We know that he maintains an online Gif Displayer. Probably irrelevant, but who knows?

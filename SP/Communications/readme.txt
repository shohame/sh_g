Communications:
300

A bomb has been hidden in the north. 
Luckily for us, the bomb must be activated manually, 
so the enemy must send an agent in. 
Our mission is to intercept their communication and find the 
bomb's location before it's too late. 
The agent (who is a computer-vision expert but a terrible communication engineer) 
must send a message to his operators, then they will reply with the location. 
We noticed a suspicious communication signal from somewhere in the Carmel forests vec1.mat.

We recorded the current channel just after the first communication message vec2.mat. 
We suspect there is a new message inside the recording.

For vec2.mat we can assume the following:

Communication is in base-band
Perfect time and frequency synchronization
Your Mission:

Use vec1.mat to decode the location of the bomb from vec2.mat.
